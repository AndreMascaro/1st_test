# 1st_test
This is my first repository
And here I am learning how to make an edit and create a branch to a project
Addition of climate conditions: light rains and nobody can leave home
IN this edit I add some personal data: Age 48, weight 88 kg

But what about if I make changes in the files via wordpad on Windows? Will the changes update my repository on Github.com?
